# ðŸ“· Image Deblurring using Numerical Optimization  

### ðŸš€ Overview  
This project explores **image deblurring** using **LU decomposition, QR factorization, Householder QR, and regularization techniques**.  
It addresses numerical instability in direct matrix inversion and enhances reconstruction quality through **adaptive regularization and iterative methods**.  

### ðŸ”¬ Key Methods  
- **LU & QR Decomposition** â€“ Standard numerical solutions for linear systems.  
- **Householder QR Factorization** â€“ Custom pivoting for improved numerical stability.  
- **Tikhonov Regularization** â€“ Mitigates ill-conditioning for better reconstruction.  
- **Iterative Optimization & Truncated SVD** â€“ Enhances Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).  

### ðŸ“Š Results  
- Achieved **up to 35% PSNR improvement** on images up to **3500Ã—3500 resolution**.  
- Compared **computational efficiency & numerical stability** across different methods.
